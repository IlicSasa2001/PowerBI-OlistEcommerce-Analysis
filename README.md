The goal of this faculty project is to thoroughly explore the Brazilian e-commerce dataset and create a variety of informative reports with different data visualization techniques, using the powerful data visualization tool, Power BI.Through meticulous data exploration and analysis, the project delves into various aspects of the dataset, including sales trends, orders by categories, orders changes by year, product attributes, customer behavior, product categories, customer preferences, and more. Each report focuses on a specific area of interest, providing detailed analysis and visualizations that offer a deep understanding of the dynamics and patterns within the Brazilian e-commerce market.
The reports created as part of this project are designed to be interactive, allowing stakeholders to dynamically explore the data and gain actionable insights. They incorporate a variety of data visualization techniques, such as charts, graphs, and maps, to present the information in visually captivating and easily digestible formats. These visualizations not only enhance the comprehension of the data but also facilitate the identification of key trends, outliers, and correlations that may influence strategic decision-making.
